# REACT ShoppingCart
This Project is a Re-Factor of a React Shopping Cart exercise from MIT XPro Full Stack Developer Class - that demonstrates restocking functionality with a back-end Strapi.IO database API.

## What Is REACT ShoppingCart?
The REACT Shopping cart lets the user put product items in a shopping cart and calculates the running price total (cummulative). This code is provided by MITxPro and our assignment was to refactor the restocking feature using the Strapi API with a database we created. In this database, I created  a list of products and when I select `restock`, the app calls to the API to fetch the products list and restock the app with these products.

### What My Code Does?
Using a REACT App provided by my MIT XPro Full-Stack Developer class, I linked this code to a Stapi Database that makes GET and POST requests for restocking.
